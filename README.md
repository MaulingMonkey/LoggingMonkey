# LoggingMonkey
Terribly terrible C# IRC logging bot

Build so people could self-serve requests for logs instead of bugging me to find old conversations for them.
An example: http://logs.pandamojo.com/?server=irc.afternet.org&channel=%23graphicschat&from=8%2F1%2F2015+3%3A00%3A00+AM&to=8%2F2%2F2015+5%3A00%3A00+PM
